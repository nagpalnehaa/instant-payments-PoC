# ðŸ’¸ Instant Payments

This project is a **proof of concept** for bank payments using a message-driven architecture. It simulates a real-time fraud screening pipeline using:

- âœ… Spring Boot (REST API)
- âœ… Apache Camel (routing & orchestration)
- âœ… ActiveMQ (messaging backbone)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Accept payment requests via REST
- Route and transform messages using Camel
- Apply fraud logic before dispatching to a queue
- Log and audit decisions for traceability

---

## ðŸ§© Architecture Overview

- **PaymentController**: Accepts payment requests (`POST /payments`)
- **CamelRouteBuilder**: Orchestrates the flow
- **FraudCheckService**: Applies fraud rules (e.g. amount, country, account)
- **AuditLogger**: Logs outcomes
- **ActiveMQ**: Receives processed messages for downstream systems
